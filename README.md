# Sticky Notes Application

## Description
The Sticky Notes Application is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to create, organize, and manage their notes digitally. The application provides an intuitive interface where users can quickly add new notes, edit existing ones, and delete notes that are no longer needed. This application is designed to mimic the ease and convenience of physical sticky notes while offering the added benefits of digital storage and organization.

## Purpose
Learning to develop a sticky notes application is an excellent exercise for software engineering students. It encompasses key aspects of programming such as user interface design, data management, and event handling. By working on this project, students will gain practical experience with important concepts like CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), data persistence, and application state management.
